  <p>So you are thinking of developing an application, in your free time! Yes you are in the right track. There are millions of side businesses, working around small niches and making profit. Put in 4 hrs a week and over a year you have a great application(provided you create something what people want) that is useful for others and more importantly, a application that people doesn&#8217;t hesitate to pay for, if you wish to monetize your app. Target the Fortune 5 million as <a href='http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/sidebusiness_software_the_neglected_software_market.php'>this blog says</a>.</p>

<h2 id='the_idea'>The Idea</h2>

<p>A great idea is a good to have! but not necessarily. I have wasted so many days for getting the &#8220;right&#8221; idea. The &#8220;right&#8221; idea is just a perfectionist&#8217;s dream. There is no right idea, but rather you make an idea right! And if you don&#8217;t have a great idea, no problem. Just for some inspiration <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CDXJ6bMkMY'>watch this video</a> by DHH. You need not have a great idea for making money. Zappos made money by selling shoes! And shoes were sold before!</p>

<p>So everything seems right, you know what you are supposed to work on and you embark on your project. So the next thing that you should do is to find out if the idea that you finally decided to work on has some, or say atleast so many customers that you can earn just enough to keep it going - the break even point is possible. So you can test this out by either running some ads in Adsense (and checking out if some one clicks on them) or in some other ad networks depending on whom your target audience is. And discuss your idea with every possible person you know on every single forum. You can try out <a href='http://news.ycombinator.com/'>HackerNews</a>, <a href='http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/?biz'>Business of Software</a>, just to name a few and the people there are always willing to give out their opinions and comments.</p>

<h2 id='what_technology_should_i_use'>What technology should I use?</h2>

<p>Ok. Now that you have decided to write code, what framework should I use to write code - Some of my recommendations based on personal choices: If you are building a web application, use jQuery as your javascript framework - that makes javascript coding a lot easier. And for server side frameworks, when it comes to the choice of programming language - just choose whichever you are most comfortable with. I have tried <a href='http://kohanaphp.com/'>Kohana framework</a> in PHP and <a href='http://djangoproject.org/'>Django</a> in Python. but the choice is totally yours. Choose something with which you can push changes and do bug fixes the fastest! And don&#8217;t waste so much time in choosing which framework, which language and don&#8217;t start comparing performance issues(all those comes later in the picture), there are more important things to be done for your business. Don&#8217;t overthink. This is not the time to think which technology is the best that will scale. First get the application working and get a handful of customers who wants your service and then if the need arises, and ONLY if the need arises scale.</p>

<h2 id='what_next'>What next?</h2>

<p>After you have had your brainstorming sessions and experimentation with what you are going to develop, you start writing the code. Use the simplest possible frameworkand the easiest possible way of doing the logic and code. Code, code and code. Make your bare bones version of the application first. The minimum possible version(the most minimum, that if you take a single word from it, the application will break). Plan out what you are going to develop before hand. Set deadlines for yourself. And maintain the code in a repository. I personally use a private repository in bitbucket.org (- you can get one private repository in Bitbucket for free). There are many online code repositories available the popular onces being github, bitbucket and a so many more. You can use Google code for hosting your code if you are okay with people taking a peep into it. You can choose between SVN or Hg(Mercurial Distributed Version Control System). I use Hg and found it to be more simpler. In case you are a beginner in using Hg; do read <a href='http://hginit.com/'>HgInit</a> - a very simple tutorial put together by Joel Spolsky.</p>

<p>I will always recommend you to have an online repository and regularly push code and keep it up to date. This can enable you to work from different locations at your free time.</p>

<h2 id='where_do_i_finally_host_my_application'>Where do I finally host my application?</h2>

<p>A very cheap hosting solution is <a href='http://google.com/appengine'>Google App Engine</a>. You can get away from choosing a framework early in your development and build your very first MVP(Minimum Viable Product - the most minimum possible application given your idea) in Google App Engine and bring in some users to it, and, gradually based on the demand, switch to other frameworks so that you can port to other hosts. PS - If you build a Google App Engine application you are pretty much stuck with using Google App Engine.</p>

<p>You can even deploy your Django application in Google App Engine. There are a lot of text available online in getting this work. Google around. But remember - the technology, the progarmming language that you use are not the first citizens in your application. What customers want is what should drive you and your time!</p>

<p>You can use hosting provided by <a href='http://www.hostmonster.com/track/ohey335'>HostMonster</a>, in case you want a bare minimal solution - which is the usual case. Or if you want VPS check out <a href='http://linode.com/'>Linode</a> and <a href='http://slicehost.com/'>SliceHost</a>.</p>

<h2 id='iterate_and_iterate_again'>Iterate and iterate again</h2>

<p>Improve your application and push code frequently. Get feedback from your customers, and your would be customers, and from the forum posts and friends. But add features carefully and be careful of the bloat. Build something that most of your users want and not just what one user wants. Use a forum like <a href='http://getsatisfaction.com/'>GetSatifaction</a> or <a href='http://uservoice.com/'>Uservoice</a> and find out what most of your customers want.</p>

<p>Engage in active discussions with your customers by starting a blog for your application. Even start a newsletter. If you have a smaller community you can use <a href='http://mailchimp.com/'>MailChimp</a> (for upto 500 users in mailing lists for free, which is usually the case in your initial days). Or build a community around. A great example of this is how <a href='http://mockupstogo.net/'>Balsamiq&#8217;s Mockups To Go</a> where they use Posterous&#8217;s post by email feature and allows their customers to build a group blog of interesting mockups. There are a million possiblities. Just think through and keep in mind your target - bringing more customers. Generate buzz, tell people what you are building.</p>
